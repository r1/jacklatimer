          <h2 className="mt-5 mb-10 space-x-4 text-gray-400">
            When I started thinking about cssbuttons I always needed a
            collection of buttons on a site which I could simply go to and paste
            the code when I needed. Before I had this idea I had to go to
            multiple different sites to find a button I liked and wanted to use
            for my project. I started having a bunch of different websites piled
            up in my notes from what buttons to use on the website I was working
            on at the time. So I came up with an idea to have a huge collection
            of buttons that I could simply copy & paste into my website.
          </h2>
          <img src="./images/cssbuttons_grid.webp"></img>
          <h2 className="mt-5 mb-10 space-x-4 text-gray-400">
            The design of the site was fairly simple. I wanted a grid layout
            where I could showcase each button in a box that I could simply
            click on then it would show me the code and the button.
          </h2>
          <img src="./images/cssbuttons_panel.webp"></img>
          <h2 className="mt-5 mb-10 space-x-4 text-gray-400">
            Then I added a side panel where I could put all of the links to the
            project and how to contribute as well as a logo for the top part of
            the site plus a few video tutorials on how to get started with CSS &
            HTML.
          </h2>
          <img src="./images/cssbuttons_layout.webp"></img>
          <h2 className="mt-5 mb-10 space-x-4 text-gray-400">
            So now I have the complete design where I could put buttons in the
            boxes and simply add the HTML button to with the corresponding CSS
            classes.
          </h2>
          <img src="./images/cssbuttons_code.webp"></img>
          <h2 className="mt-5 mb-10 space-x-4 text-gray-400">
            With the main part of the website done I had to make a page for the
            buttons code. For the code snippets I used preformatted text{" "}
            {"( <pre> )"} with code-prettify so I could colour the code.
          </h2>
          <img src="./images/cssbuttons_final.webp"></img>
          <h2 className="mt-5 mb-10 space-x-4 text-gray-400">
            With the final design done and the buttons added I then shared it to
            some websites where I could get the overall feedback for the site
            and it was very popular to my surprise. I have since gotten over
            10000 visitors to the site and great feedback.

          <img src="./images/cssbuttons_all.webp"></img>
          <h2 className="mt-2 mb-10 space-x-6 text-gray-400">
            You can find the project{" "}
            <a href="https://cssbuttons.vercel.app" target="_blank">
              if you click here

            .
